# Investigating Closed-Class Item Bias in Transformer Models

Welcome to the repository for the course project **Investigating Closed-Class Item Bias in Transformer Models**.  
This project explores the role of closed-class items in language learning and investigates whether transformer models exhibit similar biases observed in humans.

## Overview

This repository contains the data and code necessary to replicate our experiments. Specifically, it includes:  
- **Scripts** for generating artificial languages  
- **Code** for training transformer models on the generated data  
- **Evaluation scripts** for assessing model performance  

The project partially builds upon the [Rycolab artificial languages repository](https://github.com/rycolab/artificial-languages/tree/main).

## Updates

The repository is a work in progress. A detailed README with setup instructions and additional documentation will be available by **25th December**.
